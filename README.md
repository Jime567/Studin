The current BYU app has a dining feature meant to help students conveniently get food. It features a variety of on-campus restaurants with many different food options. Students can simply order online and pickup their food as soon as they arrive. If it sounds too good to be true, it's because it is. The cost of eating at one of these establishments is astronomically high, especially for a poor college student trying to make money on the side to live while going to school.

StuDin solves the problem by providing on-campus meals for free to all students. Students can simply self-report known events around campus that are giving out free food. Hungry students can check the app to find free food around them and check for future events. StuDin builds community as students help eachother to eat well while corporate chain restaurants just steal money from the community. Choose to support ending world hunger on a campus-wide level.
